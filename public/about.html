<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>All my life I've always loved working with computers. My dad got me my first computer at the age of 4 back in 2004.<br>Ever since then I always had a fasination with them. Specifically the Internet and the vast amounts of websites out there.
As a teenager I would learn how to style my tumblr pages using CSS and Html. Now that I'm an adult, I've jumped back into coding and have begun relearning coding in the pursuit to become a real web developer. I also have a passion for art so I love to incorporate my artistic skills in the websites I design. </p>
